# CRUD Operations on Model with Child Records

This scenario demonstrates performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on an object that includes a collection of child records.

## Chain

Chain requires operating on the parent and child objects separately.

## Entity Framework 6

TODO

## Entity Framework Core

When performing an update, ensure that the `EntityState` is correctly set for each child record based on whether it is an insert or update.

For partial deletes, you have to explicitly find and delete the child rows that are no longer needed.

For deletes, ensure the child record in DBContext is setup with `.OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade)`

## LLBLGen Pro

With LLBLGen Pro we can utilize straightforward ORM functionality with this, utilizing the stand-alone, database agnostic Unit of Work
class for easy transaction management and order-of-operation control. For the partial deletes two variants are implemented, one
with a removal tracker, which tracks which entities are removed and which can be deleted in one go (the `Update` method in the alt repository), 
and one with a direct delete on the table using a not-in predicate, available in the regular `Update` method. 

Nested deletes are implemented explicitly, as cascading deletes aren't supported at the ORM level; to have cascading deletes you 
have to set up the deletes as cascading on the foreign key constraint.

## NHibernate

By default, NHibernate does not support a clean separation between the data access layer and the rest of the application. This is due to the way the lazy-loading works, which requires an active `ISession` even when lazy-loading isn't desired.

The work-around is to explicitly trigger lazy-loading when the child rows are desired. When the child rows are not desired, block lazy-loading by setting the collection property to an empty list.

For partial deletes, ensure that you are using `cascade="all-delete-orphan"`. Otherwise it will ignore the missing child rows. (Alternately, you can pass in a separate list of rows to delete.)

## XPO

XPO Objects does lazy loading out of box, so you don't need to manually include or exclude linked objects and collections.

Use the [AggregatedAttribute](https://docs.devexpress.com/XPO/DevExpress.Xpo.AggregatedAttribute) to 
- automatically remove child objects once the parent object is removed,
- automatically update child rows when a parent row is updated.
