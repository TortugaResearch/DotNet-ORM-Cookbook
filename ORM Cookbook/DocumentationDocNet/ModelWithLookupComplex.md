# CRUD Operations on Model with Object-Based Foreign Key

This scenario demonstrates performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on an object that has a foreign key reference to a lookup table. The FK reference is represented as an object.

## Scenario Prototype

@snippet cs [..\Recipes.Interfaces\IEmployeeComplex.cs] IEmployeeComplex

@snippet cs [..\Recipes\ModelWithLookup\IModelWithLookupComplexScenario`1.cs] IModelWithLookupComplexScenario{TEmployee}

## Database Views

@snippet text [..\OrmCookbookDB\HR\Views\EmployeeDetail.sql] 

## ADO.NET

In order to promote code reuse, object population has been moved into the model's constructor.

@snippet cs [..\Recipes.Ado\Models\EmployeeComplex.cs] EmployeeComplex

Likewise, a database view was used to join the Employee table with its lookup table(s).

## Chain

Chain does not support representing FK's as child objects for create/update operations. The FK must be exposed via the parent object.

Read operations must occur against a database view in order to get the properties from the child object. The `Decompose` attribute indicates that the child should be populated from the same view.

## Dapper

Dapper does not support representing FK's as child objects for create/update operations. The FK must be exposed via the parent object.

Read operations must occur against a database view in order to get the properties from the child object. The [Multi Mapping](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper#multi-mapping) overload indicates that the child should be populated from the same view. Use the `splitOn` parameter to indicate the primary key of the second object.

## DbConnector

## Entity Framework 6

TODO

## Entity Framework Core

Child objects outside of the DBContext (e.g. from a REST call) need to be mapped to an object created by the DBContext.

This provides a layer of safety, as otherwise clients could override data in the lookup table.

## LINQ to DB

TODO

## LLBLGen Pro

As LLBLGen Pro supports change tracking in the entities it doesn't have to refetch an entity that's been updated. The repository code 
illustrates this. As it also by default persists all reachable entities in a graph, recursive saves are disabled here to make sure only the
entity that's passed in is persisted. 

Entity classes are always derived from a known base class so types created by the user aren't taken into account when traversing the graph, 
only entity classes.

## NHibernate

TODO

## RepoDb

RepoDb does not support representing FK's as child objects for create/update operations. The FK must be exposed via the parent object.

> RepoDb supports [*ExecuteQueryMultiple*](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/wiki/Multiple-Resultsets-via-QueryMultiple-and-ExecuteQueryMultiple#executing-multiple-sql-statements) which can cater a much more optimal solution for fetching parent-children related data entities.

Read operations must occur against a database view in order to get the properties from the child object. The `Decompose` attribute indicates that the child should be populated from the same view.
