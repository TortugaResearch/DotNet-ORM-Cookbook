# Bulk Inserts

This scenario demonstrate how to perform bulk inserts. In order to improve performance, this uses database-specific APIs rather than SQL. 

is used for large collections where SQL isn't appropriate.  operations on collections of 1,000 to 100,000 objects. Some ORMs require special handling for collections of this size. Others use the same pattern seen in .

Smaller collections should be handled with a batch insert. This is described in [CRUD Operations on Multiple Objects](MultipleCrud.htm) and [Batch Inserts with Large Collections](LargeBatch.htm)
